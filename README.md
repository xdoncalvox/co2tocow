# Language Redirect and CO2 Emissions Calculator

This simple web project includes two parts: a language redirector and a CO2 emissions calculator.

## Description

### Language Redirect

When a user visits the index page, they are automatically redirected to a page in their preferred language based on their browser settings. The supported languages are English, Spanish, and Chinese.

### CO2 Emissions Calculator

The CO2 emissions calculator estimates the amount of CO2 emissions produced by a flight, based on the selected aircraft model and flight distance. It also provides a comparison with the number of cows needed to produce an equivalent amount of methane.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Host the files on a web server.
3. When a user accesses the index page, they will be automatically redirected based on their browser language.
4. Access the CO2 emissions calculator page (`co2_calculator.html`) directly from the browser.
